# Own Vehicles Visualizer Mod for Cities: Skylines

This mod adds the ability to quickly show and highlight the paths of vehicles in Cities: Skylines. By clicking on a building or vehicle with specific key combinations, you can reveal the paths that the vehicles associated with that building or vehicle take.

## Features

- Quickly show all building's vehicles paths just by clicking on them with Shift.
- Optionally, highlights targets the vehicles are going to.
- Works in all infomodes (including default infomode).

## Controls

When selecting a vehicle:
- If Shift is pressed, turns on showing the vehicle path.
- If Alt is pressed, highlights the vehicle source and target buildings.
- If Ctrl is pressed, expands effects to all vehicles of the selected vehicle's source building.

When selecting a building:
- If Shift is pressed, turns on showing the building's own vehicle paths.
- If Alt is pressed, highlights the building's own vehicles' target buildings with green, the current building with yellow, and buildings from where incoming vehicles are going to this building with red.

When selecting a public transport vehicle:
- If Shift is pressed, turns on showing the vehicle path.
- If Alt is pressed, highlights current passengers' target buildings.
- If Ctrl is pressed, instead of showing the vehicle's path, shows its passengers' paths instead (including parts of paths on public transport).

Notes:
- Paths are highlighted differently for outgoing and vehicles returning to the facility (the returning are lighter).
- Paths are shown with alpha blend so that several overlapping paths could better be distinguished.
- Outside connections are also highlighted when appropriate, but you won't probably see it because of smog and the fact that they're very far away.
- Three-type building highlighting makes sense for warehouses, factories, and industrial buildings.
